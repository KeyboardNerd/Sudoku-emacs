# emacs_sudoku
Sudoku game in emacs.

"num-key" to enter the number; "0" to clear the number

"r" to reload the board

"p" to get solution (experimental)

"d" to save the current board

"l" to load a board

install:
load-file <.el file path>
start:
M-x sudoku

Tips:
1. If you change the code and want to test it, use C-x k to kill the sudoku buffer first if it's in buffer.
2. Some emacs version can't run the game because they don't support special-mode.
